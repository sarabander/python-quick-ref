# Python quick reference

This is a short cheat sheet for python 3.1. I wanted a quick reference
for the core language that was short (2 pages tops) and beautiful and
free. I found some but not quite what I was looking for, so I made
this one using LaTeX. You can compile it from source or you can
download it here:

Sarabander made some adjustments in typesetting and color, used a
vector graphics for the Python logo and fixed the URL.
