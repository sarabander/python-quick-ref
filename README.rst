 Python quick reference
========================

This is a short cheat sheet for python 3.1. I wanted a quick reference
for the core language that was short (2 pages tops) and beautiful and
free. I found some but not quite what I was looking for, so I made
this one using LaTeX. You can compile it from source or you can
download it here:

I made small adjustments in typesetting and color. Python logo is now
in vector graphics. Fixed URL. Thanks for sharing this!
